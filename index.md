## Do you think you need to improve your time?

Meet Tempo, an app to help you increase your productivity by stimulating breaks in your daily tasks.
We believe that being productive is to stop when necessary, and we aim to make rest be seen as synonymous with productivity as well, not just hard work.

### Life is like music
Have you ever heard any music without music breaks? It becomes just a strange continuous sound: tiring, without harmony or rhythm. Equally, life makes no sense if you just work or study continuously without ever stopping, never resting.
Breaks give life a better Tempo. 

### Features

```markdown
- Track your work time, or better yet, your break time
- Increase your productivity by resting
- Make your time more flexible and enjoyable
```
